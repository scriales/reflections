When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share the code for others and when I need to have a backup of code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually I always have the control of my code automatically doesn't make sense for me

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is only a github concept, clones is a git and github tool same as branches. Fork when I want to change anothers repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To work individually in my changes and then check if anyone else made changes in the remote code.
