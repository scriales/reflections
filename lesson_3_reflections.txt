When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share the code for others and when I need to have a backup of code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually I always have the control of my code automatically doesn't make sense for me
